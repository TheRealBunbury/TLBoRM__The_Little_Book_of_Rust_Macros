# The Little Book of Rust Macros (TLBoRM)

### **Note Bene**: This version of the Little Book of Rust Macros is a fork of Veykril's instance of TLBoRM, which itself is a continuation of [Daniel Keep's original TLBoRM text](https://github.com/DanielKeep/tlborm).

> Veykril's version of TLBoRM, in its current form, is incomplete; this repo is a space for the Dallas Rust Users Group's collaborative efforts to update & expand TLBoRM as we read through the Manning book [Write Powerful Rust Macros, written by Sam Overmeire](https://mng.bz/gmY8).
> [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

View the [rendered version of Veykril's TLBoRM here](https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/) and the [repository here](https://github.com/veykril/tlborm).

For the Dallas Rust Users Group's (ie. `DRUG`'s) working copy of the TLBoRM mdbook, you can view the [rendered version of `DRUG`'s mdbook here](https://TheRealBunbury.github.io/tlborm/) and the [repository here](https://github.com/TheRealBunbury/tlborm__the_little_book_of_Rust_macros).

## The DRUG's Updates to TLBoRM

This instance of the book is a space for the Dallas Rust Users Group (DRUG) to update and expand the current version of the TLBoRM mdbook with information and examples for Rust's `Macros by Example` (ie. Rust's 'Declarative Macros') as well as for Rust's Procedural Macros.

**NB: This repo represents Work-in-Progress (WIP). The accuracy of the information contained herein is currently not guaranteed!**.

As such, both additions (in the form of pull requests) and requests (in the form of issues) are very much welcome.

If something's unclear, opens up questions or is not understandable as written down, fear not to make an issue asking for clarification.

The goal is for this book to become the best learning resource possible.

## Required Background Knowledge to Get the Most Out of This Book

> This book expects you to have basic knowledge of Rust, it will not explain language features or constructs that are irrelevant to macros.
> No prior knowledge of macros is assumed.
> Having read and understood the first seven chapters of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) is a must, though having read the majority of the book is recommended.
